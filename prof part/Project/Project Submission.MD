In this project, you'll gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.

Before you submit:

1.  Ensure you meet specifications for all items in the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1136/view). Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications for all of the criteria.
2.  Ensure you **have not** included your API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project files.
3.  _If you completed your project in the **Project Workspace**_, ensure the following files are present in your workspace, then click "Submit Project" in the bottom righthand corner of the **Project Workspace** page:
    *   `wrangle_act.ipynb`: code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
    *   `wrangle_report.pdf` or `wrangle_report.html`: documentation for data wrangling steps: gather, assess, and clean
    *   `act_report.pdf` or `act_report.html`: documentation of analysis and insights into final data
    *   `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv`: file as given [Twitter-Archive-Enhanced](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5bf60c1e_twitter-archive-enhanced-2/twitter-archive-enhanced-2.csv)
    *   `image_predictions.tsv`: file downloaded programmatically [Image-Predictions](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5bf60c69_image-predictions-3/image-predictions-3.tsv)

    *   `tweet_json.txt`: file constructed via API [Tweet-Json](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5bf60d25_tweet-json/tweet-json.zip)
    *   `twitter_archive_master.csv`: combined and cleaned data
    *   any additional files (e.g. files for additional pieces of gathered data or a database file for your stored clean data)
4.  _If you completed your project outside of the Udacity Classroom_, package the above listed files into a zip archive or push them from a GitHub repo, then click the "Submit Project" button on this page.

As stated in _point 4_ above, you can submit your files as a zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.
